            How Voting Works
          </Typography>
          <Typography color="black" className="w-full mt-5">
            TrailTalk uses a unique voting system where every upvote adds to an
            article's "altitude." The higher the altitude, the more visibility
            the article gains, helping great content reach more readers. On your
            profile, you can see your total accumulated altitude, showcasing
            your contributions to the community and your engagement with the
            platform.
